"""Weâ€™re now done with Django Crispy Forms. You can see the advantage 
of the crispy form tag is that you can move all your form setup into 
the form class, and just have a single line in your template to render 
it with all the right options it requires. Since you do all your other 
customization of the form in Python (such as what fields you want to 
display) it makes sense to also choose how to display your buttons, 
form tag and other helper elements in Python too."""
